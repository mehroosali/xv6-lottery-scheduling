7. random.c - fails most times, rarely passed
Goal: To have a random, not simply uniform, scheduler
(Pid difference variance > 150, Direction change > 15%)

Our Code - difference variance always > 150 but Direction change achieved max is 14%. sometimes the check fails with < =6%. mean percentage is 8-12%. 

After CPU=1, Direction change % has dropped to  max 7%.

8. setticket.c - works

9. stress_equal.c - failed

Goal: Achieve variance of <55 in ticks for many processes with the same number of tickets

check failed: Variance too high

10. stress_manylow.c - failed

Goal: Achieve <7% error in tick difference between a single high ticket process and many low ticket processes

Percent error: 96%
check error: Expected the process with high tickets to get a similar number of ticks as the total number of ticks of the processes with low tickets

11. switch_tickets.c - works
